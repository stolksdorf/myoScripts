MyoGamingScripts
================

A Collection of scripts for Gaming with the Myo.



## Gaming Categories
The following are common categories of games and our approaches to using the Myo with them

### Casual
Relatively simple inputs, low game speed, short play sessions

**Examples** : 2048, Tetris, Bit Trip Runner, Angry Birds, AudioSurf, Super Hexagon

**Approach**

* Primary controller
* Gestures -> key presses directly
* Streaming input -> accelermomter data

### 4X
Over world map, lots of map panning, slow and strategtic gameplay, long play sessions

**Examples** : SimCity, Age of Empires, Civ 5

**Appraoch**

* Secondary controller
* Use for map manipulation, panning and zooming
* Radial option selection

### Combat FPS
Fast gameplay, Player's hands glued to mouse and keyboard, immersive.

**Examples** : Halo, Borderlands 2, Titan Fall

**Approach**

* Not sure

### Exploratory FPS
Slow Gameplay, immersive, world interaction matters

**Examples** : Minecraft

**Approach**

* Dual Myo; One for directions, fist + movement for view panning
* One for action control

### Card Games
Turn based gameplay, Error tolerable, many on screen items to interact with

**Examples** : Hearthstone, Magic 2015, Poker

**Approach**

* Primary Controller
* Fall back to IMU - > mouse
* Find common actions and maps them to gesture sequences
